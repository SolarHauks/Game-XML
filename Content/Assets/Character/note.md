The characters are partly animated; the first four frames are for walk animation, while the others are 
for jumping (see edit below). 
There's also a badly refined slash effect

The animations are (numbering frames from 1 to 14):

WALK: frames 1,2,3,4, cycle
JUMP: frame 5 for "jump preparation", frame 6 for moving upwards, frame 7 for moving downards and frame 8 for landing
HIT: frames 9,10,9
SLASH: frames 11,12,13 (you might use them in the order 12,11,12,13 if you want an extra "preparation" frame before the actual slash)
PUNCH: 14,12 (again, you might use them in the order 12,14,12)
RUN: 15-18
CLIMB: 19-22
a single frame with character's back (frame 23)
